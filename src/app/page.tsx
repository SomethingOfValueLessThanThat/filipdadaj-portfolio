        Heyy, I’m Filip Dadaj from Liberec city, turning ideas into immersive
        online experiences.

        I’ve been hooked on creating things since I was a kid. At 14, I built my
        first PC. That sparked my love for 3D modeling and digital worlds.
        <br />
        <br />
        I’ve been gaming since I was 3, which ignited my fascination with tech.
        By 10, I was solving Rubik’s Cubes in under a minute, sharpening my
        problem-solving skills. This led me to coding and a love for Tailwind
        CSS, which perfectly blends efficiency and creativity.
        <br />
        <br />
        Today, I apply these passions to my work, approaching challenges with a
        problem-solving mindset and creative vision. I’m continually seeking
        opportunities to innovate and deliver exceptional results.
