# Welcome to my first blog post!

This is a paragraph of text. You can write as much <span>hello</span> as you want here.

## This is a subheading

Here's another paragraph. You can add **bold** or _italic_ text easily.

### Images

You can add images like this:

![Alt text for the image](/placeholder.svg?height=200&width=400)

### Lists

You can create lists:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Or numbered lists:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Code

You can even add code blocks:

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, world!";
console.log(greeting);
```

That's it for this post. Happy blogging!
